      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I'm a postdoctoral researcher at RIKEN AIP in Tokyo, Japan. Our lab is a part of RIKEN and the University of Tokyo, so I'm involved in both. 

        I focus on deep learning theory, and I'm passionate about understanding the fundamental principles behind modern neural networks. I believe this is the best way to build safe and capable AI systems in the long run. To this end, I draw on methods from various branches of mathematics in my work. Currently, my research centers on the theory behind transformer-based models, such as LLMs. 

        I'm originally from Belarus but moved to Japan a while ago. I've also lived in Germany and the UK. I have many hobbies, including yoga and hiking, and more creative ones like painting, embroidery, and cooking. I speak English, Japanese, Belarusian, and Russian.

        I'm always happy to have an interesting conversation, so please feel free to contact me at `hanna.tseran@gmail.com`.
