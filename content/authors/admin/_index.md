      Thesis: Expected Complexity and Gradients of Deep Maxout Neural Networks and Implications to Parameter Initialization. Supervisor: Prof. Guido Montúfar (Group Leader at MPI MiS and Professor at UCLA).

      Degree awarded by Leipzig University. Research conducted at MPI MiS with parallel enrollment in IMPRS.
      - Proposed a stable initialization method for deep maxout networks, achieving over 40% accuracy improvement; published in ICML.
      - Proved that expected complexity grows polynomially with depth in maxout networks despite earlier assumptions of exponential growth; published in NeurIPS.
      - Contributed to a study on loss landscapes of ReLU networks; published in TMLR.

  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
